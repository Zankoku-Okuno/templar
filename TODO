Well, I may have deleted D too early, since I forgot that the point was to have a _templating_ engine.

Anyway, I still need to integrate the Templar data-exchange format with Hajj.
Then, I'll go ahead and retrieve the templating engine
    The plan is to have Attoparsec run through the template to generate a Hajj
    The Hajj, in turn, will extract information from a templar, and meanwhile build an output text
Then, I just need a driver wrapped around to join up the template and the input to produce output
